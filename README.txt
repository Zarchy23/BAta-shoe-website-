Bata_Zimbabwe_Website - Bata Zimbabwe Website Prototype

Files included:
- index.html, products.html, about.html, store-locator.html, promotions.html, contact.html, cart.html, checkout.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/app.js
- assets/img/* (placeholder images)

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html in Chrome or Firefox (mobile-first).
2. Products page has search & category filter. Add items to cart (localStorage persists the cart).
3. Store locator uses Leaflet (online) and contains sample store markers for Zimbabwe.
4. Contact form uses a simple client-side CAPTCHA and simulates submission.
5. Modal appears once per session offering a newsletter discount (simulated).
6. No backend required â€” all functionality is client-side for assignment demo.

Notes:
- Replace placeholder images with real Bata photos and update contact details before final submission.
- Instagram/Facebook embeds are placeholders; add official embed code or SDK keys if available.
